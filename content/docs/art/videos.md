## Integrity of The Loyal

{{< details title="Additional Commentary" open=false >}}
A short project me and a couple of friends made over winter break, directed, produced, written etc etc by the wonderful [**Sebastian Lennox**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOxoLflyycFRrsPFCX2d3xA). I had a part as one of the characters, and played the cello for the soundtrack, which I still am quite proud of. It definetly is quite rough around the edges but is notable as it is the first sort of "film production" type thing I got to be a part of.
