# Poems Written By Denis

A collection of the poems I have written, or more appropriately *doodled* which I thought warranted at least putting them out there. A small info section is written bellow each poem if I have anything interesting to say about it.

## Life of a Spud
When you're down there, try not to make a sound;  
Don't show yourself too much, lest you get found;  
I hope you're not claustraphobic, can't move around:  
This is your life as a spud, deep underground.  

You better pray that they don't find you,  
cause if they do you're screwed.  
They'll bag you up straight from the ground  
I know, kind of rude!!!

You're nothing to them,  
Nothing but delicious food.  
And they're getting ready to put you  
In the stew they brewed.  

Or maybe put on a plate,  
With a dressing endued,  
Then by a critic reviewed.

Or maybe you're used as an Hors d'oeuvres,  
Thrown in a side dish with a bunch of herbs;  
Maybe you become a traditional family meal,  
Feeding generations of children in a way that's quite real.  

You won't feel pain, or heatbreak, emotional distress;  
You literally can't get depressed or even have some slight stress,  
I mean you can't technically be happy, but nonetheless:  
I see living as a spud as an absolute success.  

Mashed, baked, fried, thrown in a sauté,  
Any way you end up, you're still gourmet.

This is what I say to all the haters:  
You're just jealous you can't all be taters.

You may think life gets boring, can't learn, love, or play.  
But you get to be potato, so I think it's all ok. :)

This was a project for a highschool English class.
I believe creating this poem may have been one of the crowning achievments of my life.
I am quite fond of potatoes.

## Wilt
The many lives  
I cannot **count**,  
who wanted more   
now lay spread out   

they wished for hope  
wished not for war;  
now they wish  
for nothing more  

than to rest  
like **flowers**;  
wilted,  
on the floor.

This poem was written as part of a simple escape room puzzle I was designing.
The details have gone fuzzy on me, but from what I can recall, I had used a lot of different fonts on each of the words, and left a clue which would give the reader the hint to *count flowers*, which they could on a painting which was in the room, in order to reveal the passcode for a lockbox. The poem, although not adventorous in any sense, seemed pretty and *cute* enough to post for its own sake.

<!-- A cool breeze in the air,   -->
<!-- crashing waves by the shore,   -->
<!-- A new kind of place,   -->
<!-- it begs me to explore. -->

<!-- A familiar place,   -->
<!-- like I've been here before... -->

<!-- yet I'm left wanting more. -->

## As We Fall

Life, a journey with no end ever in sight  
Our only fear: God won’t hold our favour  
The world stricken down with unholy light  
Civilization won’t have a savior  

Rivers, mountains, and valleys fade away  
All we love, vanished into thin air  

Calm greens and deep blues turn to murky browns  
It seems that our Earth, God thought to dismiss  
The soil where we stand, beneath us breaks down  
Now starts the fall, down the endless abyss  

The choice is yours on how you shall spend  
The silent moment right before the end.

Reading this poem back, wow is it edgy. I wrote it upon entering the 9th grade, and by its style, you can definetly tell. Thought it would be fun to keep it as a reference, since it is the oldest? piece of writing which I was able to find.
