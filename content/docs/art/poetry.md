# Poems Written By Denis

A collection of the poems I have written, or more appropriately *doodled* which I thought warranted at least putting them out there. A small info section is written bellow each poem if I have anything interesting to say about it.

## Life of a Spud
When you're down there, try not to make a sound;  
Don't show yourself too much, lest you get found;  
I hope you're not claustraphobic, can't move around:  
This is your life as a spud, deep underground.  

You better pray that they don't find you,  
cause if they do you're screwed.  
They'll bag you up straight from the ground  
I know, kind of rude!!!

You're nothing to them,  
Nothing but delicious food.  
And they're getting ready to put you  
In the stew they brewed.  

Or maybe put on a plate,  
With a dressing endued,  
Then by a critic reviewed.

Or maybe you're used as an Hors d'oeuvres,  
Thrown in a side dish with a bunch of herbs;  
Maybe you become a traditional family meal,  
Feeding generations of children in a way that's quite real.  

You won't feel pain, or heatbreak, emotional distress;  
You literally can't get depressed or even have some slight stress,  
I mean you can't technically be happy, but nonetheless:  
I see living as a spud as an absolute success.  

Mashed, baked, fried, thrown in a sauté,  
Any way you end up, you're still gourmet.

This is what I say to all the haters:  
You're just jealous you can't all be taters.

You may think life gets boring, can't learn, love, or play.  
But you get to be potato, so I think it's all ok. :)

This was a project for a highschool English class.
I believe creating this poem may have been one of the crowning achievments of my life.
I am quite fond of potatoes.

## Wilt
The many lives  
I cannot **count**,  
who wanted more   
now lay spread out   

they wished for hope  
wished not for war;  
now they wish  
for nothing more  

than to rest  
like **flowers**;  
wilted,  
on the floor.

This poem was written as part of a simple escape room puzzle I was designing.
The details have gone fuzzy on me, but from what I can recall, I had used a lot of different fonts on each of the words, and left a clue which would give the reader the hint to *count flowers*, which they could on a painting which was in the room, in order to reveal the passcode for a lockbox. The poem, although not adventorous in any sense, seemed pretty and *cute* enough to post for its own sake.

## The Wayfarer
A cool breeze in the air,  
crashing waves by the shore,  
A new kind of place,  
it begs me to explore.

...

A familiar place,  
like I've been here before...

...

A familiar place,  
yet I'm left wanting more.
