## Preface

Hi, my name is Denis Khatnyuk (Денис Хатнюк). I am currently an undergraduate student studying Mathematics and Computer Science at [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/). I have a penchant for music (having casually played the cello for a number of years), and occasionally dabble in other miscellaneous fields. Throughout my endeavours and study, I found that I would occisionally bear some fruits of my labour, yet they would inevitebly get lost; likely through a combination of my faulty memory and the reckless abandon with which I would work on them. I, upon reflection, found this a pity, and have decided that it would be a worthwhile endevour to archive my pursuits. 

This website, I hope, will serve as a mix of photo album and journal, which one could browse through to get an idea of what was running through Denis' head through the years.

*I also heard that a portfolio site isn't a terrible thing to put on a résumé*.

## Design Notes


Stylistically, I chose to try and present this website in a similar style to that of a journal. The reason for this was twofold. Firstly, it would help complement the type of content I would be creating on it, namely the details of projects which I embarked upon, which would work nicely as *journal articles*. The second reason was my fondness for this formal style. Effectively, I wanted to create a site which would *feel* as if it it were typeset in [$\LaTeX$](https://www.latex-project.org/). Taking this into account, writing this site as if it were a journal only seemed a natural fit for the chosen asthetic. The main font used for content on this site is [Computer Modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern), by [Donald E. Knuth](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Donald-Knuth), because of course it is. I also used [Jost](https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html) for the menu, since I wanted to differentiate the UI elements from the main content, and [Cabin Sketch](https://www.fontspace.com/cabin-sketch-font-f14968) for titles, as it reminded me of chalk on a chalkboard, which *fit the branding*. Through this all, I hope to evoke that sense of *reading a maths or similar academic text* for this site, even though what you are actually reading are a rambling fool's writings about his pet projects. Notably, this website will have dark theme if that is specified in your browser's preferences, as I acknowledge that some people have very strong opinions on that sort of thing. But, I will mainly be writing this content with the light theme in mind, as that is my prefered look (it looks more like the aforementioned *academic journal* that way), and so some images or other types of content may become less asthetically pleasing and/or readable in dark mode, as they will be created with the light theme in mind.

*It is finished. Now the real work can begin.*
